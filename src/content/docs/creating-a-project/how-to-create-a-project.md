   * **enter project details:** provide a comprehensive overview of your project by filling in the required details, including the title, description, goals, and the amount of funding you need. Make sure your description clearly communicates the purpose and vision of your project to potential investors.
   * **add a banner:** upload a visually appealing banner that represents your project. This banner will be displayed on your project page and will help attract attention from potential investors.

3. **set milestones:** milestones are crucial checkpoints for your project. Use time-lock contracts to define these milestones, ensuring that funds are released gradually as each milestone is achieved. This not only builds trust with investors but also helps you manage your project more effectively.

4. **submit for review:** after you’ve completed all the necessary steps and are confident in your project’s readiness, submit it for review by the Angor team. They will evaluate the details you’ve provided to ensure your project meets the platform’s standards and guidelines.

### project approval
once your project is listed on Angor, it will be immediately visible to all potential investors without the need for approval from any organization or authority. At this stage, it is crucial to actively engage with investors by accessing Browse, a Nostr client specifically designed for Angor projects. Through Browse, you can interact directly with investors, addressing their questions and concerns. Providing clear and thoughtful responses will help build trust and increase the likelihood of securing the necessary funding to bring your project to life.
