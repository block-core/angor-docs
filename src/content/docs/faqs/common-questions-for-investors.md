### **What is Angor and how does it benefit me as an investor?**
Angor is a decentralized crowdfunding platform leveraging Bitcoin and Nostr to ensure secure and transparent investments. Investors retain control over their funds, which are safeguarded through time-lock contracts and multisig setups, significantly reducing financial risks.

---

### **How does Angor protect my investment?**
Angor utilizes Bitcoin’s scripting language for:
- **Timelocks:** Ensuring funds are released based on agreed milestones.
- **Multisig:** A 2-of-2 setup that lets you exit a project securely if necessary.
This combination guarantees that your funds remain secure and accessible throughout the investment process.

---

### **What happens if the project doesn’t meet its funding goal?**
If a project isn’t fully funded:
- The founder can co-sign an exit transaction using the 2-of-2 multisig to return funds.
- If consent isn’t given, a predefined penalty process ensures your unspent Bitcoin is recoverable.

---

### **How do I track the progress of projects I’ve invested in?**
You can monitor projects through the **Angor Hub**, where founders share updates and milestones. Enable notifications to receive real-time alerts for key developments.

---
