## How does Angor ensure fund security for investors?
Angor implements robust security through Bitcoin smart contracts with multiple safeguards:

- **Milestone-based Fund Locking:** Funds are securely locked and only released upon milestone completion.
- **Direct Access Control:** Only investor and founder cryptographic keys can authorize fund movements, eliminating third-party risks.
- **Exit Protection:** Investors maintain the ability to withdraw unspent funds through a secure exit mechanism.
- **Trustless Architecture:** The entire process operates on Bitcoin's secure network without intermediaries or centralized control.

This comprehensive security framework creates a trustless environment that protects both investors and founders throughout the funding lifecycle.
