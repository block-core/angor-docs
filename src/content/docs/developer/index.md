# Building Your Project with Angor

Every great project starts with an innovative idea, but bringing that idea to life requires funding. Angor revolutionizes project funding by combining the security of Bitcoin with the powerful communication capabilities of Nostr, creating a unique platform where creators and investors can connect seamlessly.

## Why Choose Angor

Imagine a platform where your project's entire journey - from initial pitch to final delivery - is secured by Bitcoin and documented through Nostr's decentralized network. That's exactly what Angor provides. Whether you're building a software application, launching a startup, or creating innovative solutions, Angor offers a secure and transparent way to connect with investors who believe in your vision.

## How Angor Works

Your journey with Angor is straightforward yet powerful. Share your project vision through our Nostr-powered platform, where every update and communication becomes part of an immutable record. Investors can fund your project using Bitcoin, with funds released through milestone-based smart contracts. This creates perfect alignment between project progress and funding.

The magic happens through our dual-protocol approach:
- Bitcoin handles all financial transactions, ensuring secure and transparent funding
- Nostr manages all communication and project data, providing censorship-resistant storage and messaging

## Building Trust Through Technology

What makes Angor unique is how we use technology to build trust. Every milestone, update, and communication is cryptographically signed and permanently stored on Nostr. Funding is handled through Bitcoin's secure network using time-locked transactions and multi-signature releases. This creates a transparent environment where both creators and investors can focus on what matters - building successful projects.
