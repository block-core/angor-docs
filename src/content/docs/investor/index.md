## Investing with Angor

Welcome to Angor, a groundbreaking decentralized crowdfunding platform that represents the future of secure project investment. By seamlessly combining Bitcoin's robust security infrastructure with Nostr's transparent communication network, we've created an environment where investors can participate in promising projects with unprecedented protection and visibility. Our platform eliminates traditional intermediaries, replacing them with sophisticated smart contracts that automatically manage fund distribution and protection.

## Platform Architecture

Our decentralized infrastructure operates entirely through Bitcoin and Nostr integration, removing the need for traditional intermediaries and their associated risks. The platform utilizes advanced staged funding mechanisms that protect your investment through carefully designed milestone-based releases. We've implemented comprehensive fund recovery options and enhanced security features by leveraging Bitcoin's Taproot capabilities. Throughout your investment journey, you'll maintain direct and secure communication with project founders through the Nostr network.

## Investment Protection

### Staged Funding System

At the core of Angor's investor protection lies our sophisticated staged funding system. Your investment is secured through time-locked contracts that only release funds when specific project milestones are verifiably completed. We've implemented multiple recovery paths ensuring that unused funds can be retrieved if projects fail to meet their commitments. Every transaction and milestone verification is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing complete transparency and auditability.

### Security Architecture

Our security framework is built upon Bitcoin's advanced Taproot capabilities, providing state-of-the-art protection for your investments. The platform incorporates robust multisignature support for critical operations and implements sophisticated conditional spending mechanisms. All verification processes are fully decentralized, ensuring that no single party can compromise the system's integrity.

## Getting Started

### Wallet Preparation

Beginning your investment journey with Angor requires proper preparation. You'll need to set up a Bitcoin wallet that supports Taproot functionality - this serves as your secure gateway to the platform. Ensure your wallet is properly funded for your intended investments and take time to understand the various recovery mechanisms available to protect your funds.

Should the need arise, you'll have access to clearly defined recovery options for protecting your investment.
