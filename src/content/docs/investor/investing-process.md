# How to Invest in Projects

Before any investment can take place, Angor implements a crucial security measure: the Recovery Agreement Protocol. This is a fundamental safety feature that protects investors' funds.

## Understanding the Recovery Agreement

### What is a Recovery Agreement?
A recovery agreement is a smart contract-based commitment between the investor and project founder that:
- Guarantees your right to recover unused funds
- Sets specific conditions for fund recovery
- Establishes timelock parameters
- Documents mutual responsibilities
- Creates a binding on-chain record

### Why is it Important?
- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects investors from total loss
- **Trust Building**: Creates accountability for project founders
- **Transparency**: Clear terms for fund recovery
- **Legal Protection**: On-chain proof of agreement
- **Smart Contract Security**: Automated enforcement of terms

### How it Works
1. Investor initiates recovery permission request
2. Founder reviews investor details
3. Both parties agree to recovery terms
4. Smart contract records the agreement
5. Recovery conditions are programmatically enforced

## Recovery Agreement Process
