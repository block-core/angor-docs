## Understanding Investment Types

Angor provides two distinct investment pathways that cater to different investor needs and risk appetites. Each type comes with its own set of features and protections designed to balance investor security with project funding needs.

### Seed Investment

Seed investments represent the foundation of project funding on Angor. As a seed investor, you're entering at the earliest stage, which typically offers the highest potential returns but also requires a stronger commitment. Your investment helps establish the project's initial funding base and comes with specially designed recovery options that include time-lock penalties to ensure project stability. This longer commitment period is balanced by enhanced rights and potentially higher returns on your investment.

### Regular Investment

Regular investments open up after the seed phase, offering a more flexible entry point for investors who prefer a more established project stage. When you join as a regular investor, you'll benefit from the security infrastructure already established by seed investors while enjoying more flexible recovery options. The minimum investment requirements are typically lower, making this an accessible option for diverse investment portfolios.

## The Technical Investment Process

The investment process in Angor combines Bitcoin's robust security with Nostr's efficient communication capabilities. Here's how your investment journey unfolds:

### Recovery Agreement Setup

When you begin your investment journey, the first crucial step is establishing the Recovery Agreement Protocol. This process creates a sophisticated Bitcoin transaction template that serves as your investment's foundation. The system establishes a multi-signature arrangement between you and the project founder, implementing time-locked conditions that protect your investment. This smart contract is permanently recorded on the Bitcoin network, while detailed agreement terms are simultaneously documented on the Nostr network for transparent access and communication.

### Investment Execution

The actual investment process involves a carefully orchestrated series of technical operations. Your investment begins with the preparation of a specialized Bitcoin transaction that incorporates smart contract features. This transaction designates a secure multi-signature address for your funds and undergoes a comprehensive security verification process. Each step is validated, from checking signature requirements to confirming time-lock parameters and recovery agreement terms. Once verified, your funds are transferred and documented across both networks, ensuring complete transparency and security.

### Technical Security Measures

Angor employs a range of advanced security measures to protect your investment at every stage.

#### Bitcoin Network Security

The Bitcoin network's security is enhanced through the implementation of multi-signature technology, which requires multiple parties to approve transactions. Time-locked contracts are enforced to ensure that funds are only accessible after certain conditions are met. Blockchain verification systems provide an additional layer of security, and cryptographic ownership proof ensures that only the rightful owner can access the funds.

#### Nostr Integration Security

Nostr integration adds another layer of security with end-to-end encrypted communications, ensuring that all project updates are cryptographically signed and verifiable. Decentralized data storage prevents any single point of failure, and verifiable event chains for milestones provide a transparent and tamper-proof record of project progress.

### Investment Monitoring

Monitoring your investment is crucial to ensure its success and security. Angor provides comprehensive tools for both blockchain monitoring and project progress tracking.

#### Blockchain Monitoring

Real-time transaction status tracking allows you to monitor the status of your investment at any time. Multi-signature address balance monitoring ensures that your funds are secure, while time-lock expiration tracking helps you stay informed about when your funds will become accessible. Transaction history verification provides a complete record of all transactions related to your investment.

#### Project Progress Tracking

Project progress tracking is facilitated through cryptographically signed founder updates, which provide verifiable information about the project's status. Milestone completion verification ensures that the project is meeting its goals, while smart contract status monitoring keeps you informed about the state of the underlying agreements. Investment performance metrics provide a clear picture of how your investment is performing.

## Recovery Options

Angor offers robust recovery options to protect your investment in case of unforeseen circumstances.

### Technical Recovery Process

The technical recovery process is designed to ensure that your funds can be safely returned if necessary.

1. **Time-lock Verification**
   - The recovery period is validated to ensure that the required time has passed.
   - Rights verification confirms that you have the authority to initiate the recovery process.
   - Agreement condition confirmation ensures that all conditions of the recovery agreement are met.

2. **Recovery Transaction Creation**
   - A recovery transaction is generated, incorporating all necessary multi-signature requirements.
   - Time-lock parameters are validated to ensure compliance with the recovery agreement.

3. **Fund Return Execution**
   - The recovery transaction is broadcasted to the network.
   - Network confirmation ensures that the transaction is valid and has been accepted.
   - Investment records are updated to reflect the recovery.

### For Seed Investors

Seed investors have access to recovery options that include a time-lock penalty. These options are protected by smart contract conditions and predefined recovery parameters, ensuring clear and enforceable timelock enforcement.

### For Regular Investors

Regular investors have two recovery paths: a time-locked recovery with a penalty or a penalty-free recovery when seed investors exit. This flexibility ensures that regular investors can choose the recovery option that best suits their needs.
