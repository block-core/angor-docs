# Technical Guide for Angor Investors

When you decide to invest in a project through Angor, you'll be guided through a sophisticated yet user-friendly process that leverages both Bitcoin's security and Nostr's communication capabilities. Let's explore the technical journey of your investment from start to finish.

## The Investment Journey

Your investment journey begins with the Recovery Agreement Protocol, a fundamental security layer that protects your funds. This protocol creates a smart contract on the Bitcoin network that establishes your rights as an investor and ensures you can recover unused funds under specific conditions.

### Setting Up the Recovery Agreement

When you initiate an investment, the system first creates a Bitcoin transaction template that includes:
- A multi-signature setup requiring both you and the project founder
- Time-locked conditions for fund recovery
- Specific spending conditions based on project milestones
- Emergency recovery provisions

This transaction template is then stored on the Bitcoin network, creating an immutable record of the agreement terms. Simultaneously, the details of this agreement are documented on the Nostr network, ensuring transparent communication and easy access to agreement terms.

### Investment Execution Process

Once your recovery agreement is in place, the actual investment process involves several technical steps:

1. **Transaction Preparation**
   The system creates a Bitcoin transaction that includes:
   - Your investment amount
   - The project's designated multi-signature address
   - Recovery agreement parameters
   - Time-lock specifications

2. **Security Verification**
   Before execution, the system performs multiple checks:
   - Validates all signature requirements
   - Confirms time-lock parameters
   - Verifies the recovery agreement's presence
   - Checks the project's smart contract status

3. **Fund Transfer and Documentation**
   Upon verification, your investment proceeds through:
   - Initial Bitcoin transaction broadcast
   - Multi-signature address funding
   - Smart contract activation
   - Nostr event creation for investment record

## Technical Security Measures

Your investment is protected by multiple technical security layers:

### Bitcoin Network Security
The Bitcoin network secures your investment through:
- Multi-signature technology requiring multiple parties to approve fund movements
- Time-locked contracts that enforce holding periods
- Blockchain verification of all transactions
- Cryptographic proof of ownership

### Nostr Integration Security
Project information and communications are secured through:
- End-to-end encrypted messages between investors and founders
- Cryptographically signed project updates
- Decentralized data storage preventing tampering
- Verifiable event chains for project milestones

   - Validates your recovery rights
   - Confirms agreement conditions

2. **Recovery Transaction Creation**
   - Generation of recovery transaction
