* Time-lock contracts are a cornerstone of Angor’s commitment to fostering a secure and accountable environment for founders and investors. By releasing funds at predefined intervals, these contracts ensure that funded projects achieve measurable milestones before receiving additional capital. This method promotes transparency and trust throughout the funding process.

## How Time-Lock Contracts Enhance the Funding Experience

Traditional funding models often disburse the entirety of an investment upfront. This can present challenges for both founders and investors. Founders may lack the impetus to prioritize resource allocation or demonstrate efficient progress. Investors, on the other hand, might face the risk of misappropriated funds or unfulfilled promises.

Time-lock contracts address these concerns by creating a staged funding structure. Funds are released incrementally, contingent upon the completion of specific goals. This incentivizes founders to meticulously manage their resources and achieve tangible benchmarks. Investors benefit from the reassurance that their capital is directly tied to a project’s development, fostering a sense of trust and shared success.
