### Platform Fee
Angor charges a minimal fee of 2-3% on the funds raised, which is significantly lower than the fees charged by traditional crowdfunding platforms. This makes Angor a cost-effective choice for both founders and investors.

### No Hidden Costs
With Angor, there are no setup fees, transfer fees, or any additional hidden charges. Our fee structure is straightforward and transparent, ensuring that more of the funds go directly towards the success of your project.

## Comparison with Traditional Crowdfunding Platforms

### Platform Fee
Traditional crowdfunding platforms typically charge between 5-10% of the funds raised, which can significantly reduce the amount of money available for the actual project.

### Additional Fees
In addition to the platform fee, traditional platforms often include setup fees, transfer fees, and other hidden costs, which can further decrease the funds available for your project.

### Advantages of Angor
Angor offers lower costs and a simpler, more transparent fee structure. By minimizing fees, Angor ensures that more of the funds raised are used for what matters most—bringing your project to life.

### Example Scenario

**Traditional Platform:**  
Imagine a project that raises $100,000. With a 5% platform fee and additional charges, the total cost might reach $7,000, leaving only $93,000 for the project.

**Angor:**  
For the same project raising $100,000, Angor’s 2-3% fee would result in a total cost of just $2,000 to $3,000, leaving $97,000 to $98,000 available for the project. This means more funds go towards achieving the project’s goals, providing better value for both founders and investors.
