## Platform Overview

Angor represents a revolutionary approach to project funding, seamlessly integrating Bitcoin's proven security infrastructure with Nostr's decentralized communication capabilities. Our platform provides founders with an advanced funding mechanism that carefully balances project flexibility with investor protection through intelligently designed contracts and staged funding releases.

## Core Platform Features

### Decentralized Architecture

At the heart of Angor lies a fully decentralized architecture that eliminates traditional intermediaries and their associated costs. Your project's funding is secured directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing unparalleled security and transparency. Project communications and updates flow seamlessly through the Nostr network, creating a dual-network approach that ensures both maximum security for funds and transparent project communication.

### Smart Contract Integration

Angor harnesses the power of Bitcoin's Taproot capabilities to create sophisticated funding contracts. These contracts serve as the backbone of our platform, automatically managing the entire funding lifecycle. Through careful contract design, we've implemented automatic milestone-based fund releases, robust investor protection mechanisms, and comprehensive recovery scenarios. Our multi-signature security protocols ensure that funds remain secure while maintaining the flexibility needed for project execution.

### Transparent Project Management

We've developed comprehensive management tools that give you full visibility and control over your project's funding lifecycle. You can monitor funding status in real-time, track milestone completions, and maintain direct communication with your investors. Our platform automatically verifies milestones and generates detailed progress reports, ensuring all stakeholders stay informed and aligned.

## Project Launch Process

### Initial Setup

Starting your journey on Angor requires thorough preparation. Begin by developing a comprehensive project plan that clearly outlines your milestones and objectives.

### Project Configuration

The configuration phase is crucial for your project's success. You'll need to carefully structure your financial framework, including defining precise funding requirements and establishing milestone-based release schedules. Our platform guides you through setting up recovery mechanisms and configuring multi-signature arrangements that protect both you and your investors.

Your project documentation should encompass comprehensive technical specifications, detailed team credentials, and a clear project roadmap. We recommend including a thorough risk assessment document that demonstrates your understanding of potential challenges and mitigation strategies.
