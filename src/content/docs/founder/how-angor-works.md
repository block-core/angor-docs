## Project Setup Process

Starting a project on Angor begins with careful planning and setup. As a founder, you'll first need to outline your project's vision and goals. This includes developing a detailed timeline that shows investors exactly how you plan to progress from concept to completion. During this phase, you'll work with our platform to determine the total funding amount your project needs and how this funding will be distributed across different development stages.

The milestone schedule is particularly important - it's not just a timeline, but a commitment to your investors. Each milestone should represent a significant achievement in your project's development, something that clearly demonstrates progress and adds value. We'll help you structure these milestones so they're both achievable and meaningful to investors.

## Investment Structure

Your project's funding structure on Angor is designed to balance your needs as a founder with investor protection. The process begins with a seed investment phase, where early supporters can commit to your project under special terms. These early investors play a crucial role in building momentum for your project and demonstrating its potential to others.

We'll work with you to establish appropriate durations for each funding stage. This timing is critical - it needs to give you enough time to achieve your goals while maintaining a sense of momentum. The funding breakdown for each stage is carefully structured to ensure you have the resources you need when you need them, while keeping investors confident their funds are being used effectively.

## Security and Fund Management

Angor uses advanced Bitcoin technology to protect both you and your investors. The system creates a secure multi-signature arrangement that gives you control over project funds while maintaining investor protections. As you complete each milestone, funds are automatically released according to pre-set conditions, eliminating unnecessary delays in your project's progression.

We've designed the fund release process to be both secure and efficient. When you complete a milestone, the system automatically verifies your achievement and initiates the release of the next funding stage. This automation helps maintain trust with investors while ensuring you can focus on building your project rather than managing funding logistics.

## Investor Communication

Building and maintaining investor confidence is crucial for your project's success. Angor provides you with tools to keep your investors informed and engaged throughout your project's journey. You can easily share progress updates, technical achievements, and important announcements directly through the platform.

Our communication system helps you maintain transparency without creating additional administrative burden. You can schedule regular updates, share development milestones, and respond to investor questions efficiently through a single interface. This consistent communication helps build trust and keeps your investor community engaged with your project's progress.
